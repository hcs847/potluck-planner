# Potluck Planner

## User Story
With the Covid Crazies coming to an end, are you ready to get together with your friends and loved ones for some good food and fun? Does it seem daunting to figure out where to start and how to coordinate your first event after a 15-month long hiatus? Potluck Planner is your key to making your gathering seamless, safe, and special. You choose the people, we'll help you coordinate your meals!

## User Experience
The landing page shows the option to either sign in with an existing account create a new account. Once users have signed up for an account, they can log in to create their potluck event. Once logged in, users can set a potluck name, welcome message, date, time, location, amount of people per item, and guest list. Once the potluck event has been created, the host and other guests can sign up for certain dishes within specific categories (snack, appetizer, main course, dessert, etc.). When guests have signed up for an item, other guests can see that the item has been claimed when looking at the event details. The host is able to see all of their events on the home page. Guests can also research recipes within their food category on the 'Recipes' page. The site is responsive and can be used on any device.
